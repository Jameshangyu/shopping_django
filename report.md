# A shopping project in Python with Django
A python django drives a shopping project for purchasing items

It will be easy for buying the things which someone likes to own; Django follows MVC(Model-View-Controller) for code reusing.

## set up development environment
We could start to develop this project. Create a new folder 'shopping_django' and then use cd to get into this folder via terminal command line:

         pyenv local 3.7.0 # this sets the local version of python to 3.7.0
         python3 -m venv .venv # this creates the virtual environment for you
         source .venv/bin/activate # this activates the virtual environment
         pip install --upgrade pip [ this is optional]  # this installs pip, and upgrades it if required.
